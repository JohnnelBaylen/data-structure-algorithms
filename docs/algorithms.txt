Algorithm : 

    - A set of instuction designed to perform a specific task. 
    - In Programming it can be as simple as performing math operations to complicated operations.
    - Algorithm are different from actual implementation.

Algorithm Characteristics : 

    - Input         :   Zero or More Inputs
    - Output        :   One or More Outputs 
    - Unambuilty    :   Clear and Simple
    - Finiteness    :   Limited instuction
    - Effectiveness :   Impact of every Step

Algorithm Flow : 

    - Input    : Needed Values
    - Process  : operations
    - Output   : Result

Algorithms and Data Structures : 

    - Data Structures are set of algorithms that organizes data in a certain way.

Algorithm Complexity :

    - An Algorithm's Performance is measured by 

        * Time Complexity 

            - Represents the amount of time needed by the algorithm for it to be completed.

        * Space Complexity 

            - Represents the amount of memory needed for the algorithm in its process.
        
        - There are plenty of factors to consider in Space Complexity 

                * Instuction Space

                    - The size of the executable file of a program that varies 
                      depending on the number of lines of code. 

                * Data Space 
    
                    - The size required to store varibles and constants. 

                * Environment Space 

                    - The size required to store environment information to resume a function.
