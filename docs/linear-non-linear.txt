Linear Data Structure :

    - A Data Structure that are arranged sequentially or linearly. 
    - All data are connected to their adjacent data.

        * Example : Array, List, Queue and Stack
        
        - It is easy to implement but is not very efficient.

    * Static Data Structure : 

        - Has a fixed memory size. This is easier to access but will 
          consume memory even when the space is not in use.  

        Ex. Array 

    * Dynamic Data Structure : 

        - Has a dynamic size. It can be updated during runtime which will be efficient concerning 
          the space complexity og the program.

        Ex. List, Queue, and Stack 

Non - Linear Data Structure : 

    - A Data Structure that are Not arranged sequentially or linearly. 
    - Data can branch out to multiple data.

        * Example : Trees and 
        
                    - Tress 
                        
                          3  
                      2 < 
                    /     4  
                1 <
                    \  
                      5 - 6 

    - It can be customized to be efficient depending on the use case.
